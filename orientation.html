		<h2>Orientation</h2>
				<p>Once you have gone through the whole interview process, it'll finally be your start date within a couple weeks. Your first day you will have to go to security to get your badge, and then go to a training room. You'll usually spend the first few days mainly in the training room. During these days you'll fill out more paperwork, go over so many powerpoints, and take quizzes over the power points. Multiple different people will come speak to the group, mostly it will be HR, but also people from safety, learning, and sometimes the building GM.</p>
			<p>After all that is done, if you have to be PIT (Power Industrial Truck) trained that will  be next. Not every building has PITs, and some buildings most people are required to be PIT trained. There's a few different kinds of PITs, but the main one most workers use is called an OP (Order Picker). If you're a picker, stower, counter, problem solver, or others you'll spend most days on a PIT.</p>
