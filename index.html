				<p>This website is all about working at Amazon! All the information you will find will be from myself personally or others that have shared their experiences with me.</p>
				<p>I started working at Amazon in September of 2019 and am still employed, so everything should be up to date!</p>
				<p>There are a few different kinds of Amazon buildings. There are sortable fulfillment centers, non-sortable fulfillment centers, sortation centers, receive centers, return centers, and delivery stations.</p>
				<p>Explanation of each building: </p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>Sortable Fulfillment Centers: </strong>Sometime these buildings can also be AR sort centers using robots. Associates pick, pack, stow, count, and ship customer orders. These buildings usually handle smaller items.</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Non-Sortable Fulfillment Centers: </strong>Associates still pick, pack, stow, count, and ship items, but these are usually larger items than a normal Sort-Center handles.</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Sortation Centers: </strong>Associates sort customer orders by the final destination. The packages are then loaded onto the trucks and this helps for a faster delivery time.</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Receive Centers: </strong>These buildings take in huge orders of the inventory, and then divide it out to Fulfillment Centers within the network.</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Return Centers: </strong>Takes in returns and handles them. If broken the items are disposed of, or can be sent to a Fulfillment Center to be resold if possible. </li>
						<li>
							<strong>Delivery Stations: </strong>Where orders are prepared for the last delivery to the customer. All the packages they receive have already been organized and they only receive packages for the area. This is where packages are placed on the delivery vans and sent out be to delivered to the customer.</li>
