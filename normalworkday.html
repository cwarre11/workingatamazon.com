		<h2>Normal Work Day</h2>
			<p> To sum it up- a normal day you clock in, work, take a break, work again, take another break, work some more, and then go home. There's a lot of pros and cons about working for Amazon, so I'm going list some of them.</p>
			<h3><u>Pros</u></h3>
				<ul>
					<li>If you're full time you receive vacation, paid time off, and unpaid time off. You can come in early or late, leave whenever you want, or just not show up at all. You can use unpaid time or paid time off to cover this. Vacation requires a 24 hour notice and must be approved.</li>
					<br>
					<li>Before COVID the break rooms had arcade games, air hockey tables, indoor basketball, huge Connect4 games, and more. There is regular tables to eat at and tvs on every wall, but there also use to be couches to be able to hang out at. We aren't allowed to use any of the games or couches right now, but it used to be a nice half hour break from work.</li>
					<br>
					<li>Amazon has employee app called A to Z. You can see your schedule, report time off, accept voluntary overtime, see notification, check your pay stubs, and way more. It's great.</li>
					<br>
					<li>Usually you work four 10.5 hour shifts, which gives you 3 days off a week if you're not on overtime!</li>
					<br>
					<li>If you're someone who loves overtime, most of the year you have plenty of opportunities to work OT.</li>
					<br>
					<li>You start at $15.00 an hour, which isn't awful for somewhere that hires anyone with a heartbeat.</li>
				</ul>
			<h3><u>Cons</u></h3>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>You only get 48 hours of paid time off a year and 80 hours of unpaid time off a year. Vacation will change depending on how long you've worked for Amazon. You have to accrue time, which makes it difficult to take time off when you first start.</strong>
						<ul><br>
							<li><strong>Paid Time Off: </strong>Accrue the 48 hours at a little over 3 hours every other week. This means you will stop accruing PTO at the end of May. Part time receives even less PTO, so this needs to be used wisely. PTO can be used by minutes thankfully.</li>
							<br>
							<li><strong>Unpaid Time Off: </strong>You will get 80 hours a year, but will receive it quarterly. You will get 20 hours of UPT dropped in January, April, July, and October. UPT has to be used in hour increments. So if you're only a minute late, you don't want to use a whole hour of UPT, right? You can just go to the app and put in for one minute of PTO and save the hour of UPT.</li>
							<br>
							<li><strong>Vacation: </strong>This amount changes based on how long you've been employed continuously with Amazon. Must be submitted at least 24 hours before the requested time and has to be approved by your manager. During "peak" (Thanksgiving to Christmas) you aren't allowed to use vacation at all. The system will automatically deny it. So you work to gain time off, but can't use it. Great isn't it?</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<br>
					<li><strong>Amazon knows EVERY single thing you do.</strong>
						<ul><br>
							<li>There are cameras all over the building, like ridiculous amounts of cameras. I was scared to use the bathroom when I first started.</li>
							<br>
							<li>You are also labor tracked, meaning every single thing you do on a scanner or computer- they know about. They can see where you're working, the exact time you started and ended a task, how long it took you to get to your next task, and what you did in each of those tasks.</li>
							<br>
							<li>If you take too long or too many bathrooms breaks you'll get in trouble for Time off Task (ToT).</li>
							<br>
							<li>If you took too long between your tasks and they see you have ToT they'll ask and want an explanation.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<br>
					<li><strong>You have a rate, and you're expected to hit it.</strong>
						<ul><br>
							<li>If you don't hit rate, they'll ask you why.</li>
							<br>
							<li>They'll have a list printed out of all your ToT that they see as the reason you didn't have to hit rate. We work 10.5 hour shifts but they'll still ask you something ridiculous like "what were you doing from 11:23-11:35" and they think I'm supposed to remember that somehow.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<br>
					<li><strong>Mandatory Overtime.</strong>
						<ul><br>
							<li>During Peak you'll have so much overtime you want to cry, along with a few random other weeks during the year. Last year I didn't get to have a Thanksgiving because I had to work 6 days in a row.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<br>
					<li><strong>No job security. I mean at all.</strong>
						<ul><br>
							<li>You're so easily replacable and they don't care that you know. Every day I go into work I'm worried that day could be the day I get fired over literally anything.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<br>
					<li><strong>Raises are close to impossible.</strong>
						<ul><br>
							<li>After a year you get a $0.25 raise, and at two years you get another $0.20 raise. For a company that can't keep employees you would think they could do  better than that.</li>
							<br>
							<li>You also max out at 3 years. So if you've managed to stay at Amazon for 3 years or more, congratulations! You no longer get raises unless they're company wide.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
			<br>
		<p>Amazon tries a little bit to be a cool place to work at but it's not worth it overall. If you need a job ASAP this is a good place for you to work until you find a better one, just don't make it a lifelong thing.</p>
